# Plan for improvements

## Overall structure

- [ ] Modify all solutions to use the input downloader instead of committed inputs
- [ ] Purge committed input files from all branches in github
- [ ] Move years into separate subfolders and make naming more consistent

## 2023 improvements

- [ ] Get day 24 to work for sample input
- [ ] Make day 24 validate that the solution is a solution
- [ ] Extract better linear system solver from day 24
- [ ] Investigate whether you can optimise day 23 more
- [ ] Investigate whether day 23 part 1 can be done more in line with part 2
- [ ] Make day 21 work with sample input
- [ ] General refactoring and improvement for day 21
- [ ] Make day 20 part 2 solve the problem in code. Make day 20 part 2 bail out if assumptions don't hold
      (e.g. in sample input there is no rx. More assumptions about strongly connected components etc)
- [ ] Tidy up day 20 decompile.txt (purge with filter-repo?)
- [ ] Make day 18 also show part 1 solution
- [ ] Consider alternative approaches to day 10 (part 2)
- [ ] Validate assumptions and solve day 8 part 2 within the program
- [ ] Day 6, parse input instead of hardcoding
